### üöÄ How to Use Enhanced AI

1. **Get API Keys**:
   ```bash
   # Get Gemini API key (recommended)
   # Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   
   # Optional: Get OpenAI key for fallback
   # Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Copy example configuration
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and set your API keys
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   DEFAULT_AI_MODEL=gemini
   ```

3. **Test the System**:
   ```bash
   # Run AI capabilities test
   python test_ai_capabilities.py
   
   # Run installation check
   python check_installation.py
   ```

4. **Use Enhanced NOVA**:
   ```bash
   # Start NOVA normally
   python main.py
   
   # Test God Mode with AI questions
   # Type: "What is machine learning?" or "How does AI work?"
   ```
